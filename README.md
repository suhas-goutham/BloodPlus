# BloodPluss
This application helps connect hospitals with blood donors in real-time. In cases of emergency, where blood donors are required urgently and time is of the essence, this application sends a notification on nearest users' smartphones, and once a donor accepts to donate, he is directed to the hospital using Google Maps.
